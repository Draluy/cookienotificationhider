# Cookie Notification Hider
Firefox extension that hides the pesky messages that ask you whether you'd like to accept cookies or not, without accepting them.

This addon does not work automatically for every website, as each website has to be tested manually. Feel free to open a MR or a bug ticket to add more websites to the supported list.

**Please submit an issue if you find any bug, or find a website that is not supported.**
